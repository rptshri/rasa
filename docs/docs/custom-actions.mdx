An action can run any code you want. Custom actions can turn on the lights,
add an event to a calendar, check a user's bank balance, send the user a message,
or anything
else you can imagine.

Custom actions are run by the [action server](action-server.mdx), which could 
be the Rasa SDK or an SDK in any other language. 

## Input to Custom Actions

Regardless of which language your action 
server is written in, 
your custom actions will have access to the same conversation data. 
The payload sent to your custom action server includes the 
`domain` (your bot's domain) and the `tracker`.

### Tracker

The tracker lets you access the state of the conversation in your custom
actions. You can get information about past events and the current state of the
conversation by querying the tracker.

The following are available as attributes of a `Tracker` object:

* `sender_id` - The unique ID of person talking to the bot.

* `slots` - The list of slots that can be filled as defined in the
  domain.

* `latest_message` - A dictionary containing the attributes of the latest
  message: `intent`, `entities` and `text`.

* `events` - A list of all previous events.

* `active_form` - The name of the currently active form.

* `latest_action_name` - The name of the last action the bot executed.

For example, using the informaton in the tracker, you could

- Get the value of a slot from the `slots` field and query a database according to it's value
- Validate a slot value during an active [form](forms.mdx)

## Output from Custom Actions

The expected response from the action server is a dictionary of responses and events. 
For example, the following response payload would result in the slot 
`user_is_registered` being set to `False`, and the user would receive
a message saying, "You are not yet registered on this platform". 

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "SlotSet": 
      {
        "user_is_registered":false
        }
    }
  ],
  "responses": [
    {
      "text": "You are not yet registered on this platform",
      "buttons": [],
      "elements": [],
      "custom": {},
      "template": null,
      "image": null,
      "attachment": null
    }
  ]
}
```
